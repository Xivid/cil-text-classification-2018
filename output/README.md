* `models/` - any output for a model will be placed into a subdirectory here, including logs, summaries, checkpoints, and Kaggle submission `kaggle_*.csv` files, 
* `datasources/` - any intermediate files generated by the preprocessing of a data source, which can reduce the preprocessing time for subsequent runs.
